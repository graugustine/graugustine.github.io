In a non-professional setting, you can typically find me at a coffee shop or a brewery enjorying some nice beverages with even nicer friends. In my spare time I'm often bingeing new shows on Netflix or Hulu (currently I'm **obsessed** with [*Locke & Key*](https://www.netflix.com/title/80241239) and [*Harlots*](https://www.hulu.com/series/harlots-18edbd1f-3e9f-46a0-8dc4-02ff7b1eef63)), reading novels (right now I'm bouncing between [*Flowers in the Attic*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43448.Flowers_in_the_Attic) by V.C. Andrews and [*Lily and the Octopus*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27276262-lily-and-the-octopus) by Steven Rowley), or discovering new podcasts (I'm making my way through both [*This Podcast Will Kill You*](http://thispodcastwillkillyou.com) and [*Zealot*](https://www.facebook.com/zealotpodcast/)).  

Recently I've became quite the chef thanks to the help of [Tasty](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJFp8uSYCjXOMnkUyb3CQ3Q/featured) videos and their wonderful [cookbooks](https://www.tastyshop.com/cookbook). Cooking has become a sort of therapy for me and has taught me that not not everything has to be perfect, and even imperfections can turn out amazing (if only I had pictures of all my failed attempts at poaching an egg).  

I like to consider myself well-traveled since I've been to a dozen or so countries, but I am eager to get my passport stamped many more times. I am (pratically) fluent in French and try to keep up with it by reading daily articles from [Le Parisien](https://www.leparisien.fr) and [Charlie Hebdo](https://charliehebdo.fr) or listening to French language podcasts like [Transfert](http://www.slate.fr/podcasts/) and [La Poudre](http://www.nouvellesecoutes.fr/la-poudre/). I started learning German my freshman year of college in an effort to prepare for a week-long trip to Berlin at the end of the semester, and in doing so sparked an interest in language learning. While studying abroad in Prague I learned quite a bit of Czech, though my skills are likely comparable to that of a Czech elementary schooler. The term "polyglot" is a bit exagerated to describe me, but I hope that one day I can earn such a title and be able to commuinicate with people from all over the world in their native langauge.  

Since graduating college, I've also rediscovered my joy of learning and have been teaching myself a wide array of skills that I hope will be useful in the business world. So far I've gotten a pretty solid grasp on how to use Tableau to analyze large datasets, and I'm currently using GitHub to improve my coding skills (this website is a prime example). I also started learning about Azure and the role it plays in the daily operations of many companies. I'm particularly fascinated by cloud computing and our ability to effectively change the world through technology, and I hope that one day I am able to contribute to this revolution.
