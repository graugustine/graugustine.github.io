# About Me

Hi there! My name is Greg Augustine and I am a graduate from North Dakota State University with a BA in economics. While I was a student, I was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity where I was the Eminent Correspondent, a position that functioned as the PR Chair for the fraternity. In this role, I designed a wide variety of marketing materials for recruitment and philanthropy events and was the admin for the [Twitter](https://twitter.com/saendsu), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/saendsu/), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SAEatNDSU/) pages as well as for [our website](http://www.sae-ndsu.com).

I have classroom experience using data analysis software to employ programming languages such as R, SQL, and Matlab. I am self-taught in using Tableau and am currently learning to code using GitHub. Additionally, I am working on the Azure fundamentals learning path with a goal of passing the AZ-900 exam.  If you'd like to learn more about my education, work experiences, or special skills, check out my online [resume](resume.md).
